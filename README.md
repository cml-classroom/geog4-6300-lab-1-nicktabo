Question 1: Correct<p>
Question 2: The question said to summarise across months, as your table is basically the original one with separate lines for each month.<p>
Question 3: This code works. Round would have worked if you used mutate and removed the df name: `tmin_mean_south %>% mutate(tmin_mean=round(tmin_mean, 1)`<p>
Question 4: Looks great<p>
Question 5: Correct, but you needed to use kable on the pivot_wider object you created. There's a REALLY long table here.<p>
Question 6: Good<p>
Question 7: Good<p>
Bonus:
